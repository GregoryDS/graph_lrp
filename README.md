# Graph Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (GLRP)
This is an implementation of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) for [Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09375).
The code here is devoted for the paper "Explaining decisions of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks: patient specific molecular sub-networks responsible for metastasis prediction in breast cancer" submitted to [ECCB 2020 conference](https://eccb2020.info/).
The implementation of LRP for Graph CNN is in *components* folder.
The folder *lib* contains modifed by me code from MichaÃ«l Defferrard's [Graph CNN](https://github.com/mdeff/cnn_graph) repository.
